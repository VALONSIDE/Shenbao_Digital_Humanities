# Analysis of Anxiety Marketing Strategies in "Shen Bao" (1927-1937)

## 📌 Abstract
This project adopts a Digital Humanities approach to analyze advertising strategies in *Shen Bao* (申报) during the "Golden Decade" (1927-1937). By combining text mining (Python), automated coding, and structural equation modeling (SmartPLS), we investigate the historical roots of contemporary anxieties (Appearance, Knowledge, and Health).

## 📂 Project Structure
* `src/`: Python source codes for scraping, processing, and visualization.
* `data/`: Processed datasets including encoded advertisements and survey results.
* `output/`: Generated visualizations (IEEE standard charts, Word Clouds).

## 🛠️ Methodology
1.  **Data Acquisition**: Semi-automated scraping using Selenium.
2.  **Text Mining**: `Jieba` segmentation and dictionary-based "3S" coding (Scare, Scientific Authority, Vision).
3.  **Visualization**: Generating stacked bar charts with hatching patterns (IEEE style).
4.  **Empirical Study**: Conducting a survey (N=19 pilot) and Path Analysis using SmartPLS.
